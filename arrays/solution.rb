# solution.rb for Arrays
# Below we have given you an array and a number. Write a program that checks to see if the number appears in the array.


# arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
# number = 3

# if arr.include?(3)
# 	puts "#{number} is in our array!"
# else
# 	puts "#{number} is not in our array!"
# end

# arr.each do |number|
# 	if number == 3
# 		puts "#{number} is in our array, oh yeah!"
# 	end
# end

numbers = [1, 3, 4, 7, 99]
